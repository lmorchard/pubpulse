I appreciate and respect CoD, GoW, TLoU, Souls, and some of these other gritty, cinematic games, but, to me, they're just less... pure gaming?</p><p>I'll probably buy Nintendo consoles as long as they make them (or until I die, whichever comes sooner), and now I'm gradually introducing my five-year-old to current and past Nintendo games now (Pokemon Stadium is his favorite so far), so that also makes it kind of a lucrative strategy long-term.

Something that has jumped out to me is that the vast majority of \"best games\" on every console not put out by Nintendo or SEGA have an ESRB rating of M or T.</p><p>This makes some sense. Adults are making these lists, so they're going to connect with games made for adults. Also, publishers make great games specifically for adults because adults can spend money on these games. But I just think about how, with some of these retro consoles, I wouldn't have been allowed to play most of the T games or any of the M games when they were released.<br>1/2</p></td>\n",
